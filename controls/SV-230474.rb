tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    RHEL 8 systems providing tools to interface with audit information will
leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools,
and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions
regarding the access to audit tools.

source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
