Determining the correct time a particular event occurred on a system is critical when conducting forensic analysis and investigating system events.

Not exposing the management interface of the chrony daemon on the network diminishes the attack space.

RHEL 8 utilizes the "timedatectl" command to view the status of the "systemd-timesyncd.service". The "timedatectl" status will display the local time, UTC, and the offset from UTC.
