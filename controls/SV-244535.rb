work and moves away from the immediate physical vicinity of the information
system but does not log out because of the temporary nature of the absence.
Rather than relying on the user to manually lock their operating system session
prior to vacating the vicinity, operating systems need to be able to identify
when a user's session has idled and take action to initiate the session lock.

    The session lock is implemented at the point where session activity can be
determined and/or controlled."
