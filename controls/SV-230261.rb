libraries, then those changes might be implemented without undergoing the
appropriate testing and approvals that are part of a robust change management
process.

    This requirement applies to RHEL 8 with software libraries that are
accessible and configurable, as in the case of interpreted languages. Software
libraries also include privileged programs that execute with escalated
privileges. Only qualified and authorized individuals will be allowed to obtain
access to information system components for purposes of initiating changes,
including upgrades and modifications.'
