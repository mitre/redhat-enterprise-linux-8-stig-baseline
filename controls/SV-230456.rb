  title 'Successful/unsuccessful uses of the chmod, fchmod, and fchmodat system calls in RHEL 8 must generate an audit record.'
  desc 'Without generating audit records that are specific to the security and mission needs of the organization, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter). The "chmod" system call changes the file mode bits of each given file according to mode, which can be either a symbolic representation of changes to make, or an octal number representing the bit pattern for the new mode bits.

The "fchmod" system call is used to change permissions of a file.
The "fchmodat" system call is used to change permissions of a file relative to a directory file descriptor.

When a user logs on, the AUID is set to the UID of the account that is being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to "-1". The AUID representation is an unsigned 32-bit integer, which equals "4294967295". The audit system interprets "-1", "4294967295", and "unset" in the same way.

The system call rules are loaded into a matching engine that intercepts each syscall made by all programs on the system. Therefore, it is very important to use syscall rules only when absolutely necessary since these affect performance. The more rules, the bigger the performance hit. Performance can be helped, however, by combining syscalls into one rule whenever possible.'
  desc 'check', 'Verify RHEL 8 generates an audit record upon successful/unsuccessful attempts to use the "chmod", "fchmod", and "fchmodat" syscalls by using the following command to check the file system rules in "/etc/audit/audit.rules":

$ sudo grep chmod /etc/audit/audit.rules

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S chmod,fchmod,fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chmod,fchmod,fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod

If the command does not return an audit rule for "chmod", "fchmod", and "fchmodat", or any of the lines returned are commented out, this is a finding.'
  desc 'fix', 'Configure the audit system to generate an audit event for any successful/unsuccessful use of the "chmod", "fchmod", and "fchmodat" syscalls by adding or updating the following line to "/etc/audit/rules.d/audit.rules":

-a always,exit -F arch=b32 -S chmod,fchmod,fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod
-a always,exit -F arch=b64 -S chmod,fchmod,fchmodat -F auid>=1000 -F auid!=unset -k perm_mod

The audit daemon must be restarted for the changes to take effect.'
