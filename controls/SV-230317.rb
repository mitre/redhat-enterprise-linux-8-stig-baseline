  desc "The executable search path (typically the PATH environment variable)
contains a list of directories for the shell to search to find executables. If
this path includes the current working directory (other than the user's home
directory), executables in these directories may be executed instead of system
commands. This variable is formatted as a colon-separated list of directories.
If there is an empty entry, such as a leading or trailing colon or two
consecutive colons, this is interpreted as the current working directory. If
deviations from the default system search path for the local interactive user
are required, they must be documented with the Information System Security
Officer (ISSO)."

$ sudo grep -i path= /home/*/.*

If any local interactive user initialization files have executable search path statements that include directories outside of their home directory and is not documented with the ISSO as an operational requirement, this is a finding.'
