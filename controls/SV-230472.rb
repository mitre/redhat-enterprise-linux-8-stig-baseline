the tools used to view and manipulate log data. Therefore, protecting audit
tools is necessary to prevent unauthorized operation on audit information.

    RHEL 8 systems providing tools to interface with audit information will
leverage user permissions and roles identifying the user accessing the tools,
and the corresponding rights the user enjoys, to make access decisions
regarding the access to audit tools.

    Audit tools include, but are not limited to, vendor-provided and open
source audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.'

modification by checking the permissive mode.
